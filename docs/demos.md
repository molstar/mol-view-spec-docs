# Demonstrations

The following demos showcase how MolViewSpec helps with creating interactive stories and visualizations.

## [Kinases Story](https://molstar.org/demos/mvs-kinase-story/)

BCR-ABL is a classic case of how structural biology can drive drug discovery. This story will help you 
understand the role of BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia and how the drug Imatinib works. The source code can be found
[here](https://github.com/molstar/molstar/tree/master/src/examples/mvs-kinase-story).

## [I/HM Restraints](https://molstar.org/demos/ihm-restraints/)

Visualize structural restraints for integrated hybrid models (I/HM). The source code can be found 
[here](https://github.com/molstar/molstar/tree/master/src/examples/ihm-restraints).
